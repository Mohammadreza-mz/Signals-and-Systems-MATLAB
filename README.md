# Signals & Systems Course

This repository contains my answers to the MATLAB homework for the Signals & Systems course in Fall 2021.

There were also theoretical assignments, but I won't include them here. If you notice anything that is wrong, feel free to let me know. ðŸ˜Š

A brief explanation of some important questions for each HW is provided below:

### HW1
- Plotting signals
- Writing a function to calculate the convolution of two signals
- Calculating the magnitude and phase of signals

### HW2
- What are filter and impz functions?
- Calculating the Impulse response
- Calculating the step response

### HW3
- Estimating the value of a signal using finite Fourier series
- Calculating the Fourier transform of a signal
- Calculating the magnitude and phase of signals for Fourier transformation

### HW4
- Implementing 2D convolution for images
- Supporting padding and stride
- Applying convolution on images with different filters, including:
  - Gaussian
  - Horizontal edge
  - Vertical edge
  - Sharpening
  - Vertical Sobel
  - Horizontal Sobel
  - Averaging
